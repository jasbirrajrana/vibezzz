## Using the Project's Standard Commit Messages

This project is using the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standard. Please follow these steps to ensure your
commit messages are standardized:

1. Make sure your terminal path is in the root of the project (not inside any of the packages).
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Stage the files you are commiting with `git add [files]`.
4. Run `npm commit`. This will start an interactive prompt that generates your commit message:
   1. Select the type of change.
   2. Type the scope. This is either `global` for project-wide changes or one of the packages (client, server etc.).
   3. Write a short, imperative tense description of the change.
   4. If the above was not sufficient, you may now write a longer description of your change (otherwise press enter to leave blank).
   5. y or n for whether there are any breaking changes (e.g. changing the props of a component, changing the JSON structure of an API response).
   6. y or n for whether this change affects an open issue, if positive you will be prompted to enter the issue number.
5. Your commit message has now been created, you may push to your fork and open a pull request (read below for further instructions).
